Toolbar
- Factoring-out toolbar into separate layout file
- Toolbar needs to be set as actionbar in the layout (via setSupportActionBar)
- Theme in styles.xml needs to declare that no default actionbar will be used

Sidemenu
- DrawerLayout necessary
- Activity needs to use setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled() and setHomeAsUpIndicator() on toolbar for opening it via a custom "main menu" icon
- Root of sidemenu view needs to specifiy android:layout_gravity="start" (!)


RecyclerView
- For using RecyclerView add dependency: compile 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:+'
- Declare RecyclerAdapter Class extending RecyclerView.Adapter
- RecyclerAdapter uses a list of items and provides the databinding for these items
- Adapter needs to provide CRUD methods for updating the view
- List item separator can be included in item layout
- Interaction with item can be dealt with using a selector for background color and a simple OnTouchListener
- Selection of items and constituents of items, e.g. item menu can be dealt with using OnClickListener
- For match_parent height assignment, parent must be provided on inflation!, see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24503760/cardview-layout-width-match-parent-does-not-match-parent-recyclerview-width
